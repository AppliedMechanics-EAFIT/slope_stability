	abstract = {It is not safe to employ the classical infinite slope failure analysis procedure in which the Coulomb failure criterion is used, because a very large portion of the factor of safety is assigned to the effective cohesion which is not present in the soil. Part of the problem arises from the normal stresses used in the drained direct shear tests, which are high relative to the normal stresses prevailing in surficial failures. The real effective strength envelope is curved, and it is proposed to model it by a power function whose parameter values may be determined from the usual shear tests performed at the normal stress magnitudes usually employed. Based on the factor of safety calculations from the curved failure envelope and observations from field rainfall infiltration experiments, the mechanics of surficial failure of slopes is explained. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {TRIGRS (Transient Rainfall Infiltration and Grid-based Regional Slope-Stability{\textbackslash}nModel) is a Fortran program for computing transient pore-pressure{\textbackslash}nchanges, and attendant changes in the factor of safety, due to rainfall{\textbackslash}ninfiltration using the method outlined by Iverson (2000). We have{\textbackslash}nextended Iverson's (2000) method by implementing the solution for{\textbackslash}ncomplex storms, a solution for additional basal boundary conditions,{\textbackslash}nand a simple runoff-routing scheme. The program operates on a gridded{\textbackslash}nelevation model of a map area and accepts input from a series of{\textbackslash}nASCII text files. Infiltration, hydraulic properties, and slope stability{\textbackslash}ninput parameters are allowed to vary over the grid area thus making{\textbackslash}nit possible to analyze complex storm sequences over geologically{\textbackslash}ncomplex terrain. The optional routing scheme achieves mass balance{\textbackslash}nbetween rainfall input, infiltration, and runoff over the entire{\textbackslash}ngrid by allowing excess water to flow to downslope cells that are{\textbackslash}nreceiving less direct precipitation than they are able to absorb.{\textbackslash}nThe program saves output to a series of text files that can be imported{\textbackslash}nto GIS software for display or further analysis. Analyses using TRIGRS{\textbackslash}nare applicable to areas that are prone to shallow precipitation-induced{\textbackslash}nlandslides and that satisfy other model assumptions reasonably well.{\textbackslash}nThese assumptions include nearly saturated soil, a well-documented{\textbackslash}nflow field and relatively isotropic, homogeneous hydrologic properties.{\textbackslash}nThe saturated soil assumption is approximately satisfied during the{\textbackslash}nwinter rainy season in parts of the U.S. Pacific coast region (Baum{\textbackslash}nand others, 2002). Significant hydraulic heterogeneity may cause{\textbackslash}nerrors at boundaries between materials of differing hydraulic properties{\textbackslash}nbecause TRIGRS uses infiltration models for a homogeneous, isotropic{\textbackslash}nmedium. However, we have not evaluated the magnitude of such possible{\textbackslash}nerrors. Model results are very sensitive to the initial conditions,{\textbackslash}nparticularly the steady component of the flow field and initial depth{\textbackslash}nof the water table. Consequently, the model may produce questionable{\textbackslash}nresults where the initial water table depth is poorly constrained.{\textbackslash}nTRIGRS runs in a simple input/output window with relatively little{\textbackslash}nuser interaction. The user controls an analysis by means of an initialization{\textbackslash}nfile that contains the names of all other input and output files{\textbackslash}nas well as other parameters needed to run the program. The following{\textbackslash}ndiscussion will briefly describe system requirements for running{\textbackslash}nthe program, installation, features and limitations of the program,{\textbackslash}nand provide a detailed description of the initialization file. A{\textbackslash}ntutorial helps familiarize the user with program features and operation.},

We have parallelized the four time-demanding execution modes of TRIGRS, namely both the saturated and unsaturated model with finite and infinite soil depth options, within the Message Passing Interface framework. In addition to new features of the code, we outline details of the parallel implementation and show the performance gain with respect to the serial code. Results are obtained both on commercial hardware and on a high-performance multi-node machine, showing the different limits of applicability of the new code. We also discuss the implications for the application of the model on large-scale areas and as a tool for real-time landslide hazard monitoring.},
